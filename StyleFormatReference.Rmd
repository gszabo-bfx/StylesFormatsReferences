## reference into text Insert 

This is a simple text to insert a bibliography key. Let's insert the key here: @R-base, hope we can see.

## place reference list in specific location

To place Reference list into a specific location:
put 

\<div id="refs"></div\>

## Change reference format

To change the format of the references, use file 

biomed-central.csl

and insert "csl: biomed-central.csl" into YAML header


# References

<div id="refs"></div>

```{r }

```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
